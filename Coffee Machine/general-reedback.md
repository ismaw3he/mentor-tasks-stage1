### 0 - Files

Every time be sure that you wrote `.gitignore` and add necessary files to ignore.

In current rope I found `.idea` folder 3...**three!** times.

### 1 - Payment

It'll be better to show the price of chosen drink somewhere near the input and if there is not enough payment - show the error message below the input.

### 2 - JS Structure

Probably it'll be easier to navigate if you separate your code to several files, that will be added in the bottom of html separately one by another.
