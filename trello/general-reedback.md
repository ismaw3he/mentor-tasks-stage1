### 1 - Classes

If you used classes - use them for hole the project.
And almost all of your listeners will became a methods, global variables(uhh...) will became just properties and so on.

### 2 - Event listeners.  

Perfect situation - you have only one event listener for all your app. It allow you to manage **all** the processes in only one place. It coould be separate class of separate object with its own methods.  

The main idea is to have less listeners. But think your own head and analise, 'cause one listener is not perfect solution for all the cases. Just mind yourself that event listeners are your responsibilities on your work. The more you have - the less will be concentration level.
